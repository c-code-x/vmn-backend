# Contribution Guidelines
Thank you for contributing to our project! When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Submitting Issues or Pull Requests
When submitting issues or pull requests, it's important to follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and effective communication:

**1. Submitting Issues:**
- Before creating a new issue, take a moment to search existing ones to prevent duplication.
- Clearly describe the problem you're encountering, providing as much detail as possible.
- If applicable, include steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant context about your environment (e.g., operating system, browser version).
- Use descriptive titles and appropriate labels to categorize the issue for better organization.

**2. Submitting Pull Requests:**
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes, ensuring that each pull request addresses a single concern or feature.
- Follow the provided pull request template, which outlines the necessary information for reviewers to understand the purpose and scope of your changes.
- Adhere to coding conventions and formatting guidelines to maintain consistency across the codebase.
- Include relevant tests and documentation to accompany your changes and ensure they integrate smoothly into the project.

**Adherence to Established Standards:**
- Encourage contributors to familiarize themselves with and adhere to established coding standards, frameworks, and libraries used within the project.
- Regularly review and update coding standards to reflect evolving best practices and community feedback.

## Commit Message Conventions
Clear and descriptive commit messages are essential for maintaining a well-documented and comprehensible codebase. When crafting commit messages, please follow these conventions:

**1. Use of Imperative Mood:**
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood ("Fix", "Add", "Update", etc.) to clearly communicate the intention and purpose of each change.

**2. Brief Description of Changes:**
- Provide a concise summary of the changes introduced by the commit, focusing on the what and why rather than the how.

**3. Reference to Associated Issues (if any):**
- If the commit addresses a specific issue or task, include a reference to the corresponding issue number or identifier in the commit message. This helps maintain traceability and context within the version control history.
